# Snake-in-Python
This program is the 'classic' snake game written in Python.  Although Java may have been a better choice for this program, this script showcases Object Oriented Programming through classes.

This is a game where a snake is attempting to hit a designated target.
Once hit, the length of the snake increases
and a new target is randomly displayed in the window.
The goal of the game is to increase the length of the snake without dying.
A snake dies by either running off the window or making contact with its own body.Â
